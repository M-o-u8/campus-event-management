# 🔧 Registration System Fixes

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Registration Button Not Changing to Unregister**
**Problem**: After registering for an event, the registration button remained instead of changing to an unregister button.

**Root Cause**: The `EventRegistration` component was calling `fetchEvents()` which refreshed the data from the server, but there was a delay causing the UI to not immediately reflect the new registration status.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the `onRegistrationUpdate` callback to immediately modify the local state
- Added the new registration to the event's attendees array locally
- This ensures the UI updates instantly without waiting for server refresh

```javascript
onRegistrationUpdate={(data) => {
  if (data.success) {
    // Update the event data to include the new registration
    const updatedEvent = {
      ...event,
      attendees: [
        ...(event.attendees || []),
        {
          user: currentUser.id || currentUser._id,
          status: data.attendee.status,
          registrationDate: data.attendee.registrationDate,
          ticketId: data.attendee.ticketId,
          waitlistPosition: data.attendee.waitlistPosition,
          paymentStatus: data.attendee.paymentStatus
        }
      ]
    };
    
    // Update the events array with the modified event
    setEvents(prevEvents => 
      prevEvents.map(e => 
        e._id === event._id ? updatedEvent : e
      )
    );
  }
}}
```

### **2. "Already Registered" Error After Registration**
**Problem**: After successfully registering for an event, users would see an "Already registered" error when trying to register again.

**Root Cause**: The local state wasn't being updated immediately after registration, so the `isRegistered()` function still returned `false`, allowing multiple registration attempts.

**Solution**:
- Immediate local state update after successful registration
- Proper handling of registration status in the UI
- Added helper function `getUserRegistration()` for consistent registration data access

### **3. Inconsistent State Management**
**Problem**: The registration and unregistration functions were calling `fetchEvents()` which could cause delays and inconsistencies.

**Solution**:
- Updated `handleRegister()` to modify local state immediately
- Updated `handleUnregister()` to modify local state immediately
- Added proper error handling and notifications
- Maintained data consistency across all components

## 🔧 **Technical Improvements Made**

### **1. Added Helper Functions**
```javascript
const getUserRegistration = (event) => {
  if (!event.attendees || !currentUser) return null;
  
  const currentUserId = currentUser.id?.toString() || currentUser._id?.toString();
  
  return event.attendees.find(attendee => {
    const attendeeUserId = attendee.user?.toString();
    return attendeeUserId === currentUserId;
  });
};
```

### **2. Enhanced Registration Status Display**
- Added "Registered ✓" status chip for confirmed registrations
- Improved waitlist position display
- Better visual feedback for registration states

### **3. Optimized State Updates**
- Local state updates instead of server refreshes
- Immediate UI feedback
- Consistent data across all tabs

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **1. Registration Flow**
1. User clicks "Register for Event"
2. `EventRegistration` component handles the registration
3. On success, `onRegistrationUpdate` is called
4. Local state is immediately updated with new registration
5. UI instantly shows "Unregister" button
6. Registration status chip appears

### **2. Unregistration Flow**
1. User clicks "Unregister" button
2. API call is made to remove registration
3. Local state is immediately updated
4. UI instantly shows "Register" button again
5. Registration status chip disappears

### **3. State Consistency**
- All tabs (All Events, My Tickets, Registration Manager) show consistent data
- No more "Already registered" errors
- Immediate UI updates without server delays
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## 🚀 **Benefits of the Fixes**
